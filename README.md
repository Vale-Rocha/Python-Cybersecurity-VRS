## PHASE II (Ej17)

1. **Use of the Have I Been Pwned? API**  
   This script checks whether any email address has been compromised using the [Have I Been Pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3) API.

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT

To run the Python script correctly, you must include a text file named `apikey.txt` in the same directory. This file should contain your personal API key.

**Example content of `apikey.txt`: 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef

> 🔐 **Do not share your API key publicly.**  
> This key is private and should be kept secure to prevent unauthorized use.
